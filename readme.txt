🗜 Reduce page size, creating smaller, more sustainable, site output

== Description ==

> The Internet uses a lot of electricity. For most of the world, producing electricity means the burning of fossil fuels, this in turn means that the Internet’s carbon footprint may have already eclipsed global air travel.
>
> Websites are growing ever more obese, which means that the energy demand of the web is growing exponentially.

Inspired by [the Susty theme](https://sustywp.com/), I created Pressr. I recognised that few people will use a theme as stripped back as Susty and so set about creating something that would improve any existing site out there - every little helps in reducing a site's size and, therefore, its carbon footprint. So, Pressr will take your current site output and reduce it down and all without affecting how the site looks or feels(1). Simple head to Settings->Pressr and switch on the bits that you want.

Where this is different from other plugins that "optimize" your site is that reducing the page size is the only thing it's concerned about. So, some of the actions that Pressr performs may impact site SEO or performance. Everything can be individually switched via a settings page, however, and any potential impacts are highlighted.

**Note: By default, all Pressr options are switched off, so you can be confident that installing it won't affect your website. Simply head to the settings page and switch on those components that you feel comfortable with**

(1) Okay, not guaranteed, which is why I give you the option to specify which parts of Pressr are used - if anything affects your site negatively, you can switch it off.

Key features include...

* Admin settings screen allows you to precisely define what actions are performed on your site
* WordPress coding standards compliant, including WordPress VIP

== Acknowledgements ==

The biggest thanks has to go to Jack Lenox, not only for the Susty theme but his superb talks on creating a sustainable web. [Check out a video of his talk here](https://wordpress.tv/2019/08/27/jack-lenox-how-better-performing-websites-can-help-save-the-planet-2/).

Kudos to [WP Toolbelt](https://github.com/BinaryMoon/wp-toolbelt/blob/master/modules/cleanup/module.php) for some of the code ideas.

Lastly, thanks to [Tsohost](https://www.tsohost.com/) for suggesting the name Pressr. I really am bad at thinking up snappy names myself.

== Installation ==

Pressr can be found and installed via the Plugin menu within WordPress administration (Plugins -> Add New).

Alternatively, it can be downloaded from WordPress.org and installed manually...

1. Head to Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin and upload the zip file that you downloaded from WordPress.org.
2. Activate the plugin through Plugins -> Installed Plugins.

Whichever way you install Pressr, after activating it, go to Settings -> Pressr to configure.
